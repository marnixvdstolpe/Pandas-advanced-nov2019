# A Deep Dive into Advanced Pandas
### Level: Advanced

### Presentation: https://github.com/pyladiesams/Pandas-advanced-nov2019/blob/master/presentation.pdf

## Project description
During this workshop, we will dive into Advanced Pandas and explore:
- Date & time (converting to datetime, error handling, data analysis)
- Loading data (schemas, encoding, performance)
- Group By: split-apply-combine operations

## Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* pandas 0.25.3
* jupyter lab 1.2.3
* pyenv (optional)

## Usage

Using virtual environment:
* Download and install pyenv
* Clone the repository
* `pyenv install 3.6.8` (or any python version compatible)
* `pyenv shell 3.6.8` (specify which python to use)
* `python -m venv venv` (create a virtual environment)
* `source venv/bin/activate` (activate the virtual env)
* `pip install pandas==0.25.3 jupyterLab==1.2.3 matplotlib==3.1.2`
* Start jupyterLab `jupyter lab` and navigate to the workshop folder

Alternative using online notebook colab:
- requires a google account
* Connect to this website : https://colab.research.google.com/
* Click on File
* Click Open a notebook
* Under Github tab enter this URL : https://github.com/pyladiesams/Pandas-advanced-nov2019
* Press enter this will sync and show all notebooks available
* Choose workshop/X.ipynb
* Cloning the repo and installation the requirements are done through the notebook. The first time, it will take some time to spin up a machine !

Important : these steps need to be performed for every notebook since it spins up a fresh machine everytime
If you want to save your work, you can either save in your Google Drive or right click and download on your local machine
